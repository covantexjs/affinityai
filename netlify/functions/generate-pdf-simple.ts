        <h2>Your Unique Love Profile</h2>
        <p>
          As a ${archetypeName}, you bring a unique perspective to relationships that combines emotional depth, authenticity, and meaningful connection. 
          Your approach to love is deeply personal and meaningful.
        </p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            As a ${archetypeName}, you don't just experience loveâ€”you create meaningful connections that become the foundation of your personal story and identity. Your approach to relationships is both deeply personal and universally resonant.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Relationship Strengths</h2>
        <p>
          These key strengths define how you show up in relationships and what makes you a valuable partner:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deep emotional intelligence and empathy</li>
          <li>Ability to create meaningful connections</li>
          <li>Strong commitment to authentic relationships</li>
          <li>Natural storytelling ability that enriches relationships</li>
          <li>Capacity for profound emotional intimacy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Compatibility Overview</h2>

          <h3>Your Perfect Match</h3>
          <p>
            You naturally connect well with: ${compatibleWith}
          </p>
          <p>
            In real-world terms, you'll likely click with people who are spontaneous and adventurous (Vibrant Explorer types) or those who provide stability and reliability (Steady Guardian types). These personalities balance your thoughtful, meaning-focused approach with either exciting new experiences or grounding practicality.

      <!-- Page 3: Communication -->
      <div class="page">
        <h2>Your Communication Style</h2>
        <p>
          As a ${archetypeName}, your way of talking and listening is unique. You naturally go beyond small talk to create meaningful conversations that build real connection.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Your Communication Superpowers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Expressing emotions with clarity and authenticity</li>
          <li>Active listening with genuine empathy</li>
          <li>Creating safe spaces for vulnerable conversations</li>
          <li>Understanding emotional subtext and nuance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Communication Blind Spots</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Being direct about practical needs</li>
          <li>Discussing mundane topics without losing interest</li>
          <li>Addressing conflicts before they escalate</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            Pro Tip: Your depth of communication is a gift. When you need something practical (like deciding where to eat or setting a schedule), try being direct and specific rather than hoping your partner will sense what you need. Save the poetic language for the emotional moments where it truly shines.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Conflict Style</h2>
        <p>
          When disagreements happen, you tend to focus on feelings first. Instead of jumping to solutions, you want to make sure everyone feels heard and understood.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This approach has real benefits - it creates emotional safety and deeper understanding. But sometimes it can leave practical problems unsolved or drag conflicts out longer than necessary.
        </p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            Try This: When conflicts arise, start by saying "I hear you and I understand how you feel" to create emotional safety. Then add "Let's figure out a solution together" to move toward resolution. This two-step approach honors both emotional needs and practical problem-solving.

        <h2>Your Compatibility Radar</h2>
        <p>
          This visualization shows your natural compatibility with different relationship archetypes. The further the point extends outward on each axis, the stronger the compatibility.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Compatibility Radar Chart (Text Version) -->
        <div class="radar">
          <h3>Compatibility Percentages:</h3>
          <p>Steady Guardian: 85%</p>
          <p>Mindful Architect: 80%</p>
          <p>Compassionate Nurturer: 75%</p>
          <p>Vibrant Explorer: 85%</p>
          
          <p class="radar-description">
            The radar visualization would show your strongest connections with Steady Guardian and Vibrant Explorer archetypes, with slightly lower but still strong compatibility with Mindful Architect and Compassionate Nurturer archetypes.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Understanding your compatibility patterns can help you recognize potential strengths and challenges in different relationships. Remember that compatibility is just one factor in relationship success - growth, communication, and shared values are equally important.

        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            The most fulfilling relationships often involve complementary differences, not just similarities. Look for partners who share your core values but bring different strengths to balance your natural tendencies.

        <p>
          These questions align with your natural desire for meaningful connection. They invite the kind of depth and authenticity that you value in relationships. Use them when you want to move beyond surface-level conversation into the territory of real connection.
